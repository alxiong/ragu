//! Wire allocation.
//!
//! The core [`Driver`] trait has no notion of allocating a single wire — its
//! primitive is [`gate`](ragu_core::drivers::DriverTypes::gate), which
//! produces four wires at a time. Circuit code frequently needs standalone
//! wires, so this module introduces allocation as a separate concern.
//!
//! A gate's four wires $(A, B, C, D)$ are constrained by $A \cdot B = C$ and
//! $C \cdot D = 0$. When $A$ and $C$ are both zero the remaining wires $B$
//! and $D$ are unconstrained, so up to two independent values can be packed
//! into one gate. An [`Allocator`] manages this: it decides whether to
//! allocate a fresh gate or repurpose a leftover wire from a previous one.
//!
//! Allocation is a trait because different contexts call for different
//! strategies:
//!
//! - [`Allocator`] for `()` — stateless; allocates a full gate per wire.
//!   Simple but wasteful.
//!
//! - [`SimpleAllocator`] — pairs consecutive allocations into one gate,
//!   stashing the spare wire from the first call for the second. Halves
//!   gate cost for sequences of allocations.
//!
//! - [`PoolAllocator`] — pools spare `Extra` tokens
//!   [`donate`](Allocator::donate)d by external gadgets (e.g.
//!   [`Boolean::alloc`](crate::Boolean::alloc)) whose $D$ wire is
//!   unconstrained. Subsequent allocations redeem pooled tokens before
//!   falling back to new gates, and self-produced spares enter the pool
//!   too.
