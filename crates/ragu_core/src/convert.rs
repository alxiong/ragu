//! Conversions that translate gadgets from one [`Driver`] context to another.
//!
//! Gadgets are polymorphic over drivers, and translating a gadget from one
//! driver context to another while preserving its structure and semantics is a
//! fundamental operation. Any code that operates across multiple driver
//! contexts will need this: [routines](crate::routines) translate their inputs
//! onto [`Wireless`] [`Emulator`]s for prediction, wire-counting passes discard
//! wire values entirely, and driver implementations may need to inject or
//! rewrite wires during circuit analysis.
//!
//! [`WireMap`] provides a uniform mechanism for these conversions: an
//! implementor fixes a source and destination driver via associated types, then
//! converts wires one at a time. Because [`WireMap`] is a separate trait rather
//! than an associated type on [`GadgetKind`](crate::gadgets::GadgetKind), the
//! same gadget kind can be remapped by many different conversion strategies
//! without adding type parameters to
//! [`GadgetKind`](crate::gadgets::GadgetKind).
//!
//! ### Public API
//!
//! - [`WireMap`], the core conversion trait.
//! - [`CloneWires`], a [`WireMap`] that clones wires unchanged.
//! - [`StripWires`], a [`WireMap`] that discards wire values for use with
//!   wireless emulators.
