//! Shared types for wire evaluation during polynomial synthesis.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The [`sx`] and [`sxy`] evaluators compute polynomial coefficients directly
//! as field elements during circuit synthesis. Since both evaluators produce
//! immediate field element results, they can share the same wire representation
//! types defined here.
//!
//! In contrast, [`sy`] requires deferred computation through a virtual wire
//! system with reference counting, because $s(X, y)$ coefficients cannot be
//! computed in streaming order during synthesis (see [`sy`] module
//! documentation).
//!
//! ### Immediate Evaluation
//!
//! Both [`sx`] and [`sxy`] evaluate the wiring polynomial by interpreting
//! circuit synthesis operations directly. Wires become evaluated monomials
//! (field elements) rather than indices, and linear combinations become
//! immediate field arithmetic.
//!
//! ### `ONE` Wire Evaluation
//!
//! The `ONE` wire corresponds to the $c$ wire from gate 0, with monomial
//! $x^{4n-1}$. Since [`Driver::ONE`] must be a compile-time constant, it cannot
//! hold this computed value. Instead, [`WireEval::One`] serves as a sentinel
//! that [`WireEvalSum::add_term`] resolves to the cached $x^{4n - 1}$ value
//! at runtime.
//!
//! [`sx`]: super::sx
//! [`sxy`]: super::sxy
//! [`sy`]: super::sy
//! [`Driver::ONE`]: ragu_core::drivers::Driver::ONE

/// Represents a wire's evaluated monomial during polynomial synthesis.

/// wires become field elements rather than indices.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `Value(F)` — Holds the evaluated monomial for a wire from [`Driver::mul`],
///   or a linear combination of such evaluations from [`Driver::add`].
///
/// - `One` — Represents the ONE wire. This variant exists because `Driver::ONE`
///   must be a compile-time constant, but the `ONE` wire's actual evaluation
///   (e.g., $x^{4n-1}$) depends on the evaluation point.
///   [`WireEvalSum::add_term`] resolves `One` to the cached evaluation at

/// # Public Input Enforcement
///
/// Public inputs are encoded in the wiring polynomial through a dual
/// interpretation of [`enforce_zero`]. While user code sees [`enforce_zero`] as
/// constraining wire values to equal zero, the protocol actually uses these
/// constraints to bind public input values.
///
/// ### The User API
///
/// Circuit implementations call [`enforce_zero`] to create linear constraints.
/// Within [`Circuit::witness`], these calls do exactly what they appear to do:
/// they constrain linear combinations of wire assignments to equal zero.
///
/// ### Public Input Binding
///
/// The system distinguishes between two types of constraints:
///
/// 1. **Internal constraints** — Calls to [`enforce_zero`] within
///    [`Circuit::witness`] enforce that wire combinations equal zero.
///
/// 2. **Public input constraints** — Calls to [`enforce_zero`] on public output
///    wires (from [`Circuit::instance`]) and the `ONE` wire do NOT enforce that
///    these wires equal zero. Instead, they bind these wire values as
///    coefficients in the public input polynomial $k(Y)$.
///
/// For example, calling `enforce_zero(|lc| lc.add(output_wire))` on a public
/// output with value $v$ creates a constraint that binds $v$ as a coefficient
/// in $k(Y)$, not a constraint that $v = 0$.
///
/// This dual interpretation allows the same [`enforce_zero`] API to serve both
/// purposes: internal zero constraints and public input binding.
