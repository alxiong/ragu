### Ragu Aggregated Verification vs. Orchard Batch Verification

A central question for Ragu's practical deployment is: _at what point does aggregated proof verification outperform batch verification of independent proofs?_ This section establishes rough bounds for when Ragu becomes more efficient than Orchard's batch verification.

#### Background

Orchard currently uses batch verification of Halo2 proofs, achieving verification times of approximately 10–15ms per proof on a single thread. Batch verification provides sublinear scaling: verifying $N$ proofs costs roughly $O(N / \log N)$ rather than $O(N)$ due to multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) batching.

Ragu, in contrast, uses proof-carrying data (PCD) to recursively aggregate proofs. The verifier only needs to check a single aggregated proof regardless of how many underlying transactions were folded together. However, this aggregated proof is more expensive to verify than a single Orchard proof.

#### Ragu Verification Cost Drivers

Ragu's verification cost is primarily determined by:

1. **Circuit polynomial degree**: The circuit polynomial has degree $4N$ linear constraints, where $N = 2^K$ and $K$ is the recursion threshold (preferred value: $K = 11$).

2. **Multi-scalar exponentiation size**: This corresponds to an MSM of size $N = 4 \cdot 2^{11} = 2^{13} = 8192$ group elements, which dominates the verifier's computational cost.

3. **Curve cycle overhead**: Ragu operates over a cycle of curves (Pasta), which introduces additional overhead compared to single-curve constructions.

Based on these factors, we estimate Ragu verification at approximately **100ms** for the preferred recursion threshold of $K = 11$.

#### Break-Even Analysis

Comparing the two approaches:

| Approach | Cost Model |
|----------|------------|
| Orchard batch | $N_{\text{tx}} \times 10\text{ms} \;/\; \log(N_{\text{tx}})$ |
| Ragu aggregated | $\approx 100\text{ms}$ (constant for fixed $K$) |

Solving for the break-even point where Ragu becomes more efficient:

$$
\frac{N_{\text{tx}} \times 10\text{ms}}{\log(N_{\text{tx}})} \approx 100\text{ms}
$$

This yields approximately $N \approx 50$ transactions as the crossover point.

```admonish note
These are rough estimates that should be validated with empirical benchmarks. The actual break-even point will depend on hardware, implementation optimizations, and the specific circuit configurations used.
```

#### Recursion Threshold Trade-offs

The recursion threshold $K$ presents an interesting trade-off space:

- **Larger $K$**: Larger circuits mean higher verification cost, but shallower PCD trees (fewer recursive steps needed to aggregate many proofs).

- **Smaller $K$**: Smaller circuits mean lower per-verification cost, but deeper PCD trees are required to aggregate the same number of proofs.

Empirically, **doubling the recursion threshold roughly halves both**:
1. The verification time per aggregated proof
2. The number of transactions needed to reach the break-even point

This suggests an optimization opportunity: the recursion threshold can be tuned based on expected transaction volume. High-throughput scenarios may benefit from larger $K$, while lower-volume scenarios might prefer smaller $K$ to reduce verification latency.

#### Future Work

More rigorous analysis should:

1. Establish precise MSM cost models for both Pallas and Vesta curves
2. Account for parallelization opportunities in both batch and aggregated verification
3. Consider amortization across multiple blocks and the full PCD tree structure
4. Benchmark actual implementations to validate theoretical predictions
