# Grammar Review Policy

## Scope

Review sentence-level grammar and mechanics in book chapter markdown files
(`book/src/`). This policy covers voice, sentence structure, and word choice.
For text-level concerns (terminology, transitions, coherence), see
`prose.md`. All rules in `.claude/book-review/standards.md` also apply.

In addition to `.claude/review/writing.md` (shared writing rules that apply to
all project prose), the following book-specific rules apply.

## Voice Context

- Address the reader as "we" when walking through constructions together. Use
  "you" for direct instructions in the user guide.

## Sentence Structure

- Do not open a sentence with "While" as a concessive conjunction (meaning
  "although" or "whereas"). Lead with the main clause and introduce the
  contrast after a comma — e.g., "X suffices for A, but B requires Y"
  rather than "While X suffices for A, B requires Y." Temporal "while"
  (meaning "during the time that") is fine.
