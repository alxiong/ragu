# Prose Quality Review Policy

## Scope

Review text-level writing quality in book chapter markdown files
(`book/src/`). This policy covers concerns that span paragraphs or larger
units of text — transitions and coherence. For sentence-level mechanics
(voice, structure, word choice), see `grammar.md`. All rules in
`.claude/book-review/standards.md` also apply.

In addition to `.claude/review/writing.md` (shared writing rules — terminology
consistency, capitalization, etc.), the following book-specific rules apply.

## Terminology

- Defined terms from `book/src/appendix/terminology.md` take precedence over
  any ad hoc term choices.

## Transitions

- Each paragraph should connect to the preceding one. Flag abrupt topic shifts
  with no connecting logic.
- Section transitions should give the reader a reason to keep reading.
